<h1>We Don't Just Flip Houses.</h1>
New Again Houses® was born in Bristol in 2008 with one simple mission: to solve real estate problems. That mission has grown and evolved throughout the years, and now we serve homeowners not only in the Tri Cities area, but all across the country.

But we don’t just flip houses. We buy houses that need a little extra love and transform them into a home families can enjoy for years to come. Over the years, we’ve stayed on the innovative side of home buying, and we developed proprietary software that helps our National network of Franchise Owners confidently flip houses in their markets.
